**Basic system design**
### **Creational design patterns**➖

**Creational design patterns** deal with object creation mechanisms. As the name implies, these patterns provide optimized object creation techniques. They help cater to the design and complexity problems that might occur when using the basic approach.

1.  **Factory pattern :** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt1IbV1aSZ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt1IbV1aSZ4)The **Factory pattern** is a creational pattern that provides a template that can be used to create objects. It is used in complex situations where the type of the object required varies and needs to be specified in each case.
2. .  **Constructor pattern :** is a class-based pattern that uses the constructors present in the class to create specific types of objects.
3.  **Singleton pattern**➖is a type of design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object.

4.  **Builder pattern**➖The Builder pattern is a type of a creational design pattern that helps in building complex objects using simpler objects.
5.  **Prototype pattern:-** is used to instantiate objects with some default values using an existing object. It clones the object and provides the existing properties to the cloned object using prototypal inheritance.
6.  **Abstract pattern :-** We use the Factory pattern to create multiple objects from the same family without having to deal with the creation process.
